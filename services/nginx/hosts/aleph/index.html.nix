                      I have practical experience with
                        the usual development tools like git,
                        (flat)assembler,
                        reverse engineering of software and
                        I am familiar with
                          theoretical computer science,
                          cryptography,
                          Linux and
                          especially the Nix/NixOS ecosystem.
                      By operating my own server infrastructure with e-mail, monitoring, DNS, etc.
                        I was able to gain valuable experience in network and system administration.
